# plant-sensor

I love plants but I don't know much about the science about the right conditions for growing them. I have seen many versions of DIY Moisture Monitors, and want to have a go a building one myself with an Arduino. This following is a rough guide to how I'll go about building a plant sensor that can read and display soi-moisture levels, light intensity, and temperature.

What I'll need:
• Bolts, nuts, ring terminals 
• Arduino Uno 
• Solderless breadboard 
• Assorted wires 
• Thermistor 
• Photoresistor 
• 10K-ohm resistors 
• Potentiometer 
• LCD display (
